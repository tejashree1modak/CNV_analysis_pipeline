### Tejashree H. Modak, Rachel S. Schwartz

#### Duplications Characterization :

1. Script 1: post_filtration_analyses.R

This script takes the filtered duplications output from filter_dups.R as input.
Analyses includes the following:

- Genome coverage 
- Genotypes for Duplications
- Duplication lengths
- Duplication comparison across locations
- Frequency of Duplications per chromosome comparison across locations

2. Script 1: cnv_analyses.R

This script takes the filtered duplications output from filter_dups.R as input.
Analyses includes the following:

- Copy Number comparison of Duplications across locations
- Copy Number comparison of Duplications across genome
